## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://github.com/RonnyldoSilva/Install-and-Training-Tesseract-4-OCR-Opencv)

```
sudo apt-get install curl software-properties-common
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -


sudo apt-get install nodejs

node -v
npm -v 
```

* A webcam, e.g. laptop-integrated webcam, USB webcam

## Installing Node.js packages

* Navigate to the main directory
* To install the packages: `npm install`. This is take a while.

## Running the demo

* Make sure you are still in the main directory 
* To run the server: `node index.js`
* To run the demo locally, open a browser and go to `localhost:3000`

The app should be up and running!

## More about OpenCV4NodeJS

"By its nature, JavaScript lacks the performance to implement Computer Vision tasks efficiently. Therefore this package brings the performance of the native OpenCV library to your Node.js application. This project targets OpenCV 3 and provides an asynchronous as well as an synchronous API."

"The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive collection of Node.js bindings to the API of OpenCV and the OpenCV-contrib modules. An overview of available bindings can be found in the API Documentation. Furthermore, contribution is highly appreciated. If you want to get involved you can have a look at the contribution guide."
