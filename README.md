## 0. Preface

- This repository is based from [FaceHunter: A multi-task convolutional neural network based face detector](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923596516300467) and [http://sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br/rep/8JMKD3MGPEW34M/45CKFQB](http://sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br/rep/8JMKD3MGPEW34M/45CKFQB).

- The purpose of this project is to show how an intelligent security system was made, capable of recognizing gender and age, as well as counting the people present in the scene.
